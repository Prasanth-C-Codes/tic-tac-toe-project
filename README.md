# Tic Tac React

Tic Tac React is a simple and fun game where you have to make a line of three Xs or Os on a 3x3 grid. You can play with a friend on the same device.

## How to play

To play Tic Tac React, you need to clone this repository and run `npm install` then `npm start` command. You will see a blank grid on the browser. To make a move, click on the cell you want to mark. The rows and columns are numbered from 1 to 3.

You can choose to play as X or O. X always goes first. The game ends when either player makes a line of three symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally, or when the grid is full and there is no winner. Use the #Play Again button to reset the board.
